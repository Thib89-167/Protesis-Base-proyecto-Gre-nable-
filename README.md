# Protesis-Base-proyecto-Gre-nable-
This project consist in creating a prothesis that can be control by muscles. It is based on an 2018 french project named Gre-Nable already in open source. I share in this repository the report and all the archives STEP made for this project. Beware, the report is made in Spanish as my diploma took place in argentina.
